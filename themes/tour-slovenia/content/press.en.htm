<h2><strong>Covid-19 Protocol within the 27th edition of Tour of Slovenia - Media accreditation application</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Full protocol:</strong> <a href="https://tourofslovenia.si/storage/app/media/2021/TOS-Covid-19-Protocol-Media.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>TOS-Covid-19-Protocol-Media.pdf</strong></a>
	<br>The last part of the document also contains instructions for self-assessment in case of symptoms and signs of SARS CoV-2 infection. You can do a risk assessment yourself. Summary of the protocol (long version is available by clicking on the document link above): Media accreditation will be issued only if all safety regulations against the spread of Covid-19 are in place. The main security pillar against the entry of the infection with SARS CoV-2 is to provide access only to completely healthy individuals (confirmed by PCR tests), who will respect all personal protective measures and prevent the introduction/spread of the infection during the race.</p>

<p><strong>PCR tests</strong>
	<br>PCR tests for the presence of SARS CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal space are the basis of protection against the introduction of infection in order to detect asymptomatic vectors of the virus. The entire protocol of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is based on testing of all people that enter the protective bubble. To obtain accreditation, which allows access to the mixed zone and potential contact with athletes or team members can only be obtained by submitting a negative PCR test for the presence of SARS CoV-2.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The test must be taken 6 and 3 days before arriving at the race venue – valid in case of permanent residence in the bubble (= no exits/going home and contact with people outside the bubble for the duration of the race).</li>
	<li>1x PCR test 3 (2) days before arrival at the venue – valid only in case of presence on only one stage (in case of a return, a negative PCR test result is required!).</li>
	<li>1x PCR test 3 days before arrival at the venue and 1x PCR test after the 2nd stage of the race – valid in case of presence on all stages with intermediate bubble leaving (e.g. home exits after each stage).</li>
	<li>in case of vaccination against COVID-19, only 1x PCR test performed 3 days before arrival at the race venue is required.</li>
	<li>in case you were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past, only 1x PCR test is required (proof of a positive PCR test result older than 10 days, unless the doctor decides otherwise, but not older than six months, or a doctor's certificate that the person has survived COVID-19 and no more than six months have elapsed since the onset of symptoms).</li>
</ul>
