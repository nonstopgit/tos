	<div class="col-12 col-lg-6">

		<p>Recently, we have witnessed the flourishing of virtual cycling platforms, on which we can find cycling routes that simulate the actual characteristics of the race via a simulator. <strong>I feel Slovenia virtual Tour of Slovenia</strong> will take place on the <strong>Rouvy </strong>platform, whose exceptional advantage is that the cyclist observes the surroundings of the route throughout the ride with the help of real video.</p>

		<p><strong>I feel Slovenia virtual Tour of Slovenia</strong> will have <strong>5 stages</strong>, which will be on the schedule every Saturday - starting at 7 pm - between <strong>27 February</strong> and <strong>27 March 2021</strong>.

	<h2>Basic information</h2>
	<div class="col-12 col-lg-6">

		<p>Each stage will count as a stand-alone race, and at the end of each stage, the winner will symbolically win a virtual green jersey. Among those who will perform in all five stages, the green jersey for the winner will be awarded in the men's and women's categories in the age groups</p>

		<ul>
